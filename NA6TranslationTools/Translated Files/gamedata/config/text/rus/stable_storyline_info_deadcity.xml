		<text>Don't know what to say..to laugh or to be upset? I learned that I am the Shooter. The shooter who has lost her memory in one of the last trips to the Zone center. The shooter who has lost all friends except for the Doctor. The shooter, who learned something that became the subject of persecution. What I found out? Next question. The doctor managed to save the key and is the spot our group on the river. Located in one of the rooms of the former hotel in the center. He says that there must be something that will shed light on the "Wishmaster" or Monolith. He knows only one thing - after the penultimate outing to Chernobyl I always said that Monolith, bound to be some catch. Well, the Monolith will deal with you. Who are you and what are you?</text>

		<text>Doctor: When we last saw you, you left me a key to the stash in Pripyat and scheme how to find him... I managed to save them mercenaries... not found... Hold on... Maybe there's something to find... And you were muttering constantly that the Monolith is some kind of trick... That's for sure...</text>
