		<text>Bartender: "everything just went crazy when I found out! All who could immediately rushed to get to the center of the zone, loners, Freedom, Duty, even mercenaries. Who was the first to get one and get all of it! Wishmaster, the Klondike of artifacts, and God knows what else. Hurry up, if the Performer is really in the sarcophagus of the station, the one who was the first to get that desire fulfilled. Now just before going to Pripyat squad of veterans. If you hurry, will go with them."</text>

		<text>I turned off the Burner. For some reason, at the time of shutdown and lost consciousness. And saw the dream: again, the bulk of Chernobyl and the sarcophagus. Then Flash. Shining Monolith inside the sarcophagus. I understand that this is a wish granter. Stalker, ragged and emaciated, the last effort reaches out to him with trembling hands...a bright flash and I see an excerpt from the first sleep...the Person stands with his back to us and shoots. He suddenly heard a shout: "Strelok!". The man shudders, freezes for a moment and slowly begins to turn...but as the film started up in the opposite direction, scroll frames, as it automatically puts the rats back to the station...I know one thing - I was there. I have to go to the Monolith.</text>
