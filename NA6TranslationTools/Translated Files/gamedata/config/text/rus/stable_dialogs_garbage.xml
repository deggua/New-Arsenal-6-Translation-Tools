		<text>Nothing like this here and no. Dump as landfill. The North road "Bar" protect the fighters "Debt". They better not mess with, "Debt" generally gloomy guys going. Right - the passages in dark Valley, but there are very strong radiation. A little closer - "great grimpen mire", a bog, full of anomalies. Say, it can be good for the artifacts to get hold of, but for trouble to get there a lot easier. The only thing that was good - though the hound of the Baskervilles on the Moors there.</text>

		<text>Well, in General look. We're now on a big smelly dump. Here after the accident in 1986 were brought radioactive garbage, faucets, broken equipment. In General, your life is shit broken, and anomalies among the wreckage enough. Artifacts there are, however, not very good. Because there are mainly beginners and Dating. And where the first bandits enough. So it is better not to linger here. Farther East a lot of pockets of radiation, without protection there can not be. If you go South, then exit the border Zone. If you go North, you'll come to the abandoned factory "Rostock", it is a bar stalkers to find him is not difficult. In the East of the Dark Valley, the grim, perpetually foggy place. In the West the territory of the Institute Agroprom. I will mention you on the map where it is safe to move.</text>

	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_3111411121">
		<text>In the center stands a large abandoned hangar, there's basically very quiet. In an extreme case, you can spend the night. If you go to the West, in the direction of the Agricultural industry - there is a camp of bandits, and from there were these thugs that we recently shot, but I feel that this is not all.</text>
