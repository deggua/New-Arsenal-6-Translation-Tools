		<text>In the stash I found a short report about how we, together with the canine inside underground galleries around the sarcophagus at Chernobyl and found some suspicious door. Fang said that next time we will gather a decoder for the electronic lock. Then we were forced to flee. There nemeryannom monolith patrols. Well. Ready decoder according to a report we had deposited his man to Zaton, nicknamed the Owl. Now we need to obtain this decoder. To get To the Creek is possible through S. Pamidorau, which is based nearby. And have a plan how to find this door. However, as I understand it, to approach the Monolith is extremely dangerous - at least we avoided last time to get under the sarcophagus over the destroyed reactor. And the Monolith apparently there.</text>
