		<text>Great. Here, behind the hill, the main breeding ground of those bastards - the "free" that the boys gonna shake and to stir.\nThere is, however, a small problem. The entrance to The base one and is well protected. We thought to punch a hole in the fence, but theirs a sniper on the tower prevents us. Don't want to send guys to the bullets... and you let it close, just shoot definitely will not. Take it off - we owe you one, and even the equipment on the base will take what I want, if things work out.</text>
