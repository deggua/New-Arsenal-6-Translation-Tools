		<text>Thank you Tagged for all the help. It was a tough fight. We will make camp here tonight.\nIf you go further, it will tell you about the area. If you return back to transition and go right to reach the bus station. But there hurt the ground is open and unsafe.\nIf you go forward, you will be in front of the hotel. The right base of the monolith. The guys without a roof.\nFor the base stadium. We were planning on using him to the station to get. That's all.</text>
